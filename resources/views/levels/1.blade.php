<div id="art_desc" aria-hidden="true">A picture of the butterflies flying in a group.</div>

<p>Beryl's first victim was the butterflies. This was mean, as the butterflies
are very pretty and can't do anything to anybody. Except maybe flutter at them.</p>

<p>Can you crack the code to find where the butterflies have been locked away?</p>
