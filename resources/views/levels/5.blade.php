<div id="art_desc" aria-hidden="true">A picture of Leo the Lion in happier times.</div>

<p>Finally, only Leo the Lion is left. I'm quite surprised Beryl the Terrible managed to get hold of him.
    He's quite scary when he's grumpy! She must be very brave, or just very terrible. He can't have
    gone far!
</p>

<p>Where's Leo? What's the last secret hiding place?</p>
